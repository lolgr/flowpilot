# Flowpilot stand alone
This is a fork of Flowpilot without the need of rooting or a Termux environment. Install the apk and you're done. Requires a Snapdragon based Android phone.

Main features of this fork:
* Standalone apk without additional software requirements
* Android device rooting is not required
* Improved UI resolution

Huge shout out to the original [Flowpilot](https://github.com/flowdriveai/flowpilot) and [Phr00t's fork](https://github.com/phr00t/flowpilot).

# Building notes
Clone:
* `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/jagheterfredrik/flowpilot.git`
* `cd flowpilot`
* `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Setup the environment once:
* Install Docker with [non-root management](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
* `./build_env.sh`

Then build using
* `./build.sh full`

One can also build only subcomponents:
* To package the Python code:
  * `./build.sh flowy`
* To build only binary requirements:
  * `./build.sh scons`
* To package the Android app:
  * `./build.sh app`

## Android

The Android app contains an in-app camera pipeline that uses Camera2/CameraX to feed frames into the model.

### USB / External camera (UVC) support 🔌

The app now detects external (USB/UVC) cameras exposed by the system and will use them automatically when available. You can also force a camera id or request an external camera explicitly by setting the `ROAD_CAMERA_SOURCE` environment variable before launching the app (for example in an intent or the app environment):

 - `ROAD_CAMERA_SOURCE=external` — selects the first external camera (if present)
 - `ROAD_CAMERA_SOURCE=<camera_id>` — selects a specific camera id as reported by the system

If no external camera is found (or no override is provided), the app falls back to the default built-in camera.
